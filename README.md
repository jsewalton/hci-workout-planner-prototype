## GitHub Copilot Prompts

**Prompt 1: Help me generate a high-fidelity prototype for a workout app. On the home page, users are able to toggle their fitness goals. When they click ‚ÄúNext‚Äù, they are taken to another page that asks them to select their preferred workouts and workout times. Afterwards, they can then sync to their Google, Outlook, or iCloud calendars which will lead them to a view of a personalized weekly workout calendar generated by taking into account user preferences and their weekly calendars.**

GitHub Copilot: I'll help you create a high-fidelity prototype for your workout app. Here are the HTML files for each screen:

1. Home Page - Fitness Goals Selection
{Generated HTML code}
2. Workout Preferences Page
{Generated HTML code}
3. Calendar Sync Page
{Generated HTML code}
4. Personalized Workout Calendar
{Generated HTML code}

To use this prototype:
1. Save each file with the suggested filename (index.html, workout-preferences.html, calendar-sync.html, workout-calendar.html)
2. Open `index.html` in a browser to start the user flow
3. The prototype includes interactive elements, smooth transitions, and a complete user journey
The design features:
- Modern, clean UI with gradient backgrounds
- Interactive toggles for goals and preferences
- Calendar sync simulation with loading states
- Fully functional calendar view with personalized workouts
- Responsive design that works on different screen sizes
- Statistics dashboard showing workout progress

Each page flows naturally to the next, creating a complete high-fidelity prototype experience.

A second similar prompt was used that built off the first iteration:

**Prompt 2: Help me make a final high-fidelity prototype in the prototype-2 folder for a workout app on a mobile phone interface. On the home page, users are able to toggle their fitness goals. When they click ‚ÄúNext‚Äù, they are taken to another page that asks them to select their preferred workouts and workout times. Afterwards, they can then sync to their Google, Outlook, or iCloud calendars which will lead them to a view of a personalized weekly workout calendar generated by taking into account user preferences and their weekly calendars.**
